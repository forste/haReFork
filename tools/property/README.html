<h1>Tools for Haskell extended with property declarations</h1>

<h2>What is in this directory (property)</h2>

The code in this directory defines an extended version of Haskell that
has declaration of properties. The syntax is defined by extending the
structures defined in the directory
<a href="../base/"><code>../base</code></a>.
The corresponding code for type checking etc is reused.

<p>
The main tool, <code>ppfe</code>,
reuses the extensible front-end defined in the directory
<a href="../pfe/"><code>../pfe</code></a>.

<p>
The language provided for describing properties is P-logic.
A separate page describes the <a href="Plogic.html">P-logic syntax,
as implemented by PFE</a>.
