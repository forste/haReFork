<h2>What is in this directory (hs2alfa)</h2>

This directory contains the translator from Haskell to Alfa, which is built
on top of the <a href="../pfe">PFE</a> framework and parts of
<a href="http://www.cs.chalmers.se/~hallgren/Alfa/">Alfa</a>.

<p>
By running <code>make</code> you can create <code>apfe</code>, a command line
tool that has all the functionality of the PFE framework, plus the
ability to translate Haskell files to Alfa files.

<p>
There are also two (obsolete) test programs that don't depend on the PFE
framework: <code>tstHs2Alfa</code> (for the base language, Haskell 98)
and <code>tstProp2Alfa</code> (for Hasell 98 + property declarations).
They can be compiled with <code>make</code> <var>progamname</var>.

<p>
The code compiles with GHC, provided that the directory
<code>AlfaSource</code>, containing certain modules from Alfa, is present
(get <a href="http://www.cse.ogi.edu/~hallgren/Programatica/download/alfaforpfe.tar.gz">alfaforpfe.tar.gz</a>
and unpack it in this directory).

<h3>Limitations</h3>

The translator is work in progress (as everything else here).
It does handle

<ul>
<li>the most common forms of declarations and expressions,
<li>polymorphism,
<li>classes and overloading (by the dictionary translation, which is
    performed mostly by the Haskell type checker in
     <a href="../base/TI/">../base/TI/</a>),
<li>data types and (some forms of) pattern matching,
<li>the list comprehension syntax,
<li>mutually recursive modules (by combining them into one module, name
    clashes can cause problems).
</ul>

The translator does not yet (fully) support

<ul>
<li>pattern matching with guards,
<li>literals in patterns,
<li>data constructors with labelled fields,
<!--
<li>references to default methods in instance declarations
<li>pattern bindings
<li>partially applied constructors
<li>right sections, e.g. (+1)
<li>classes with superclasses
<li>instance declarations that refer to methods of the same class
<li>instances with contexts
<li>polymorphic functions where the quantified variables have kinds other than *
-->
<li>names that are reserved in Alfa but not in Haskell
    (but <code>sig</code>, <code>.</code> and <code>Type</code> are translated).
<li>certain constructions that the Agda type checker rejects, e.g.
    <code>case let ... in ... of ...</code>
</ul>

Other problems:
<ul>
<li>Type signatures containing synonyms for function types (like ReadS) 
    can cause problems. (Workaround: comment out the type signature or
    manually expand the type synonym.)
<li>Name capture can occur, for example, in the translation of
    <pre><code>
    class Functor f where fmap :: (a->b)->f a->f b
    instance Ix a => Ix (Array a) where fmap = ...
    </code></pre>
    there will be a problem with capture of the type variable <code>a</code>.
</ul>

The translator can translate P-logic predicate definitions and property
assertions, but

<ul>
<li>the fixed point operators <code>Lfp</code> and <code>Gfp</code> are
    translated, but their meaning in Alfa is probably not what it should be.
<li>the use of constructors lifted to predicates is not yet supported,
<li>the P-logic equality operator (<code>===</code>) is translated to
    intentional equality, which differs for functions.
<!--
-->
<li>the comprehension syntax is restricted.
</ul>

<p>
The subdirectory <a href="tests/">tests</a> contains sample Haskell modules
that the translator can translate. (There are also some test files in
this directory.)
