<h1>Tools for the Programatica project</h1>

<div>
<p>
This directory contains the sources for (some of) the tools implemented
as part of the Programatica project.
<p>
<strong>This is all work in progress (including this documentation)!</strong>

<div>
<p>
See the
 <a href="features.html"><cite>Features</cite></a>
 and
 <a href="usage.html"><cite>Usage</cite></a>
 pages for documentation of the main tools. There are also some additional
tidbits lying around.

The code that has been actively developed recently is located in the following
subdirectories, some of which contain additional README files:

<table>
<tr><th>Directory<th>Description
<tr><td><a href="base/"><code>base</code></a>
<td>Extensible Haskell front-end and base language (Haskell 98) tools.
    There is a <a href="base/README.html">README</a> file with further
    details.

<tr><td><a href="pfe/"><code>pfe</code></a>
<td>PFE - the preliminary front-end framework and command-line tools.
    There is a <a href="pfe/README.html">README</a> file with further

<td>The Programatica Haskell Browser.

<tr><td><a href="property/"><code>property</code></a>
<td>Extension of the base language with P-logic property declarations,
    including a new parser and an extended type checker.
    (An awful lot of work for a small extension...)

<tr><td><code>hs2html</code>

    tool.)

<tr><td><a href="hs2alfa/"><code>hs2alfa</code></a>
<td>Haskell to Alfa translator.

<td>Haskell to Stratego translator.

<td>Files relating to evidence (certificate) management, in particular
    the command line tool <code>cert</code> and the implementation of
    the certificate servers.

<tr><td><code>scripts</code>
<td>Various shell scripts, some of which are used in the build process.

<tr><td><code>bin</code>, <code>lib</code>
<td>There are directores created by the Makefile to hold a template of
    things that get installed by <code>make install</code>.
    (See <a href="INSTALL.html">INSTALL.html</a>).
