One can use MakeMake.hs to create the makefile.
e.g. runhugs MakeMake.hs > Makefile

To make the most recent versions of the files
type "make".

IMPORTANT NOTES:
    
    * there needs to be a directory named "tmp" in the current directory.
    * might need to make the DVI file twice, to get the references right.
    * the binaries in this directory were made for Mandrake 8.1
      (will probably work on RedHat 7.2 as well, haven't tried)
        * they don't work on turing as there seems to be a missing library
        * a vesrion compiled on turing, which seems to work is available
          at /disk/hopper/users/students/diatchki/bin/Hack
          
          the Makefile has to be changed to make use of it.
