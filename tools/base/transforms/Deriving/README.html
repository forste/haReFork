<h1>Extensible Haskell front-end for the Programatica project</h1>

<h2>What is in this directory (base/transforms/Deriving)</h2>

This directory contains the code that implements Haskell's deriving
mechanism.
<p>
The derived instances refer to various functions defined in the
<code>Prelude</code> and <code>PreludeText</code> (including some
nonstandard functions to reduce the amount of code duplication).
