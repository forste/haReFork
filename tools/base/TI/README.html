<h1>Extensible Haskell front-end for the Programatica project</h1>

<h2>What is in this directory (base/TI)</h2>

This directory contains a type checker for the base
language (i.e., more or less Haskell 98). It is structured to allow large
parts to be reusable in extended versions of the language.
<p>
At present,
the type inference monad is fixed, and the AST for inferred types is fixed,
but it might be possible to factor out these aspects too.

<p>
Although various details differ, this type checker is influenced by

<ul>
<li>Mark Jones'
    <a href="http://www.cse.ogi.edu/~mpj/thih/"><cite>Typing Haskell in
    Haskell</cite></a> (general guidance, some naming conventions, the class
    <code>Types</code> and operations on substitutions, ...),
<li>one of Johan Nordlander's type checkers for
    <a href="http://www.cs.chalmers.se/~nordland/ohaskell/">O'Haskell</a>
    (that avoids both threading an accumulating substitution and
    applying substitutions to the environment),
<li>and also somewhat by the type checker in
    <a href="http://www.cs.chalmers.se/~augustss/hbc/hbc.html">HBC</a>.
   (HBC serves as a proof that you don't need to resort to imperative
   unification to implement efficient type inference, nor do you need
   to sweep things under the carpet with a monad to make a purely
   functional type checker readable.)
