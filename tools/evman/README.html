<h2>What is in this directory (evman)</h2>

This directory contains files relating to evidence (certificate)
management, in particular the command line tool <code>cert</code> and
the implementation of the certificate servers.

<p>
The code for certificate managment provided here is mostly inteded to
serve as <strong>glue</strong> between the main Programatica tools
(pfe) and external tools, such as theorem provers, and is implemented
as shell scripts (but perhaps it would be better to do all of this in
Haskell...).

<h3>Files</h3>

<dl>
<dt><a href="cert.sh"><code>cert.sh</code></a>
<dd>This is the main command-line based certificate management tool.
    It is also used from pfebrowser, so interaction with the user has to
    be designed so that it works both from the command line and in the
    GUI provided by pfebrowser.
    <p>
    Some generic certificate management functionality is implemented directly
    in <code>cert.sh</code>, while certificate type specific work is delegated
    to scripts in the <code>servers</code> subdirectory.
    At present, two functions are delegated: <code>new</code> to create new
    certificate and <code>validate</code> to validate certificates.
<dt><a href="functions.sh"><code>functions.sh</code></a>,
    <a href="validation.sh"><code>validation.sh</code></a>
<dd>Auxiliary shell functions used by many of the certificate management
    scripts.
<dt><code>Makefile</code>
<dd>Guess what...
</dl>

<h3>Subdirectories</h3>

<dl>
<dt>icons
<dd>A collection of certificate icons provided by Mark P. Jones.
<dt>servers
<dd>This directory contains implementation of servers for specific
    certificate types, with one subdirectory per server.
</dl>

<h3>Certificate server implementation</h3>

The following is required for each certificate server (some of these
things might be created automatically, using the Makefile):

<ol>
<li>Certificate type description file: <code>server.attr</code>
    (more details are given below),
<li>Certificate icons: <code>invalid.gif</code>,
    <code>unknown.gif</code>, <code>valid.gif</code>,
<li>The program <code>new</code> for creating new certificates, invoked
    from <code>cert.sh</code>,
<li>The program <code>validate</code> for validating certificates, invoked
    from <code>cert.sh</code>.
</ol>

The existing servers have <code>new</code> and <code>validate</code>
programs that are implemented as fairly short shell scripts.
An easy way to create a new server is to copy and modify an existing
one. When common patterns emerge, functions can be moved to the
<code>funtions.sh</code> or <code>validation.sh</code> files.
<p>
There is no requirement that the programs <code>new</code> and
<code>validate</code> are implemented as shell scripts. All that is
required is that the files are executable and behave as expected.

<h4>Certificate files maintained by certificate servers</h4>
<p>
Certificate servers are expected to create and maintain a number of
files for each certificate:

<table>
<tr><th>File<th>What it is used for
<tr>
<td><code>cert.attrs</code>
<td>This file holds various certificate attributes. Attribute files and
    certificate attributes are described in more detail below.
<tr><td><code>valid</code><br><code>invalid</code>
<td>These files are datestamps to indicate when the certificate was last
    marked valid or invalid. This helps tools quickly determine if a
    certificate is valid, invalid or if a more thorough test is needed to
    determine its status.
<tr><td><code>deps</code>
<td>This file records a signature of the parts of the source code that
    the certified assertion depends on. It can be generated with the
    command
    <blockquote><code>pfe tasig <var>M.A</var> >.../deps</code></blockquote>
    It allows tools to tell the
    difference between source code changes that affect the validity of
    an assertion from irrelevant changes, so that needless revalidation
    can be avoided.  It also allows the <code>I_say_so</code>
    certificate server to use the command <code>pfe tadiff ...</code> to
    present a list of relevant changes to the user.
<tr><td><code>srclist.txt</code>
<td>This file caches the list of source files containing code that the
    certified assertion depends on. Together with the <code>valid</code>
    and <code>invalid</code> datestamp files, it is often possible to
    determine the validity of a certificate just by consulting
    the last modification date of files. It is used by the command
    <code>cert ls</code>.
<tr><td><code>output.txt</code>
    <td>This is the standard place for diagnostic output from the certificate
        server. The user can consult this, for example to find out why
        certificate validation failed.
</table>

<h3>Attribute files</h3>

Both servers and the certificates they create are described by a set of
attributes that are stored in <em>attribute files</em>. There are both
Haskell functions and shell script functions to parse attribute
files.

<h4>Attribute file format</h4>

 Attribute files use a textual file format for association lists.
 Each line in an attribute file may specify a binding of a tag
 string to a value string using a single colon to separate the
 two.  If the colon is omitted, then a value of "" is assumed.
 Leading whitespace at the beginning of each line and preceding
 the value (i.e., after the first, if any, colon) is ignored.
 Lines containing only whitespace, or in which the first
 non-whitespace character is a '#' are treated as comments.
 (Despite this, we do not intend attribute files to be a
 human-readable format under normal circumstances.)

<p>
Here is a sample attribute file:

<blockquote><pre>
 # This is a comment
 
 foo: your name here!
 date:today
 
 # here is a line with no value ...
 set filec
 
 foo:bar
 # if the same tag is used more than once, then
 # we simply get multiple attribute values with
 # the same tag.
</pre></blockquote>

<h3>Server attributes</h3>

Certificate <strong>server attributes</strong> are stored in a file called
<code>server.attr</code> in the server's directory. For an example,
see <a href="servers/Alfa/server.attr">servers/Alfa/server.attr</a>

<p>
<p>The tools currently assumes the following attributes to be present:</p>

<table>
<tr><th>Attribute name<th>Attribute meaning
<tr><td><code>name</code>
<td>The name of the server
<tr><td><code>description</code>
<td>A one-line explanation of what kind of certificates the server creates.
<tr><td><code>attribute</code>
<td>Certificate attribute description. This can be given any number of times
to describe what user editable attributes are present in certificates created
by this server. (These have a specific syntax that should be documented
in more detail!)

</table>

<p>Additional fields can be present.

<h3>Certificate attributes</h3>

<p>
<strong>Certificate attributes</strong> are (to some extent) defined by the
different certificate servers. However, some attributes are expected to have
the same meaning in all certificates:</p>

<table>
<tr><th>Attribute name<th>Attribute meaning
<tr><td><code>type</code>
    <td>The name of the server that created the certificate.
<tr><td><code>conc</code>
<td>Conclusion. This is the name of the assertion that the certificate serves
    as evidence for. It should be an <em>unqualified</em> assertion identifer.
    (This is not meaningful in all certificate types.)
<tr><td><code>hyp<code>
    <td>Hypotheses. This is either <code>..</code> or a list of <em>qualified</em>
        identifiers. A more detailed description is given below.
<tr><td><code>file</code><br><code>file/</code><var>type</var>
    <td>Names of auxiliary files used to establish the validity of
        the certificate. For example, for Alfa certificates, the name of the
	file containing the proof is recorded in the attribute
        <code>file/proof</code>.
</table>

<p>Additional fields can be present.

<h4>Hypotheses</h4>

For certificates that certify a sequent
 <code><var>hyp</var>|-<var>conc</var></code>, the <code>hyp</code>
 has the following forms:

<ul>
<li><p><code>..</code>, which means that the validity of the certificate
	can depend on <em>everything</em> referenced (directly or indirectly) from the
	assertion named in the <code>conc</code> attribute.

<li>A list of qualified identifiers.
    Each identifier in the list should denote either an assertion or a value.
     <ul>
	<li>For assertion names, the hypothesis is that the
	named assertion is valid.
        <li>For value names, the validity of the
	certificate can depend on the definition of that name.
     </ul>
     	Definitions of names that are free in the assertion, or in
	definitions of explicitly listed names, do not influence the validity
	of the assertion. (In effect, free names are implicitly universally
	quantified.)

</ul>
